Last week my friend brought this guy named Kevin to my party. It was supposed to be a private get together with friends, but Kevin did not want that. He drank that night as much as he possibly could and then he screamed at the top of his lungs... as one does. He was never invited to another party, but that didn't stop him.
He continues to show up at my house, usually drunk, usually very late at night. I've heard his screams so much in my sleep that I've started hearing them in my waking hours as well, even when I'm all alone. 
I don't know why this is happening to me.
Last night, it happened again. But this time was a little different. Drunk and screaming he sat outside my house.. waiting for me. I peake outside my window and i noticed this large kitchen knife hes holding. Bloody was dripping down, I couldnt move. Next I heard banging on my door. And in that moment i knew. My life was in jepordy. I opened my second floor window and jumped out rolling onto the grass. Immediately he turned around and started chasing me.
