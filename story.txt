Last week my friend brought this guy named Kevin to my party. It was supposed to be a private get together with friends, but Kevin did not want that. He drank that night as much as he possibly could and then he screamed at the top of his lungs... as one does. He was never invited to another party, but that didn't stop him.
He continues to show up at my house, usually drunk, usually very late at night. I've heard his screams so much in my sleep that I've started hearing them in my waking hours as well, even when I'm all alone. 
I don't know why this is happening to me.
This day, I am really tired after finishing whole days work. As usual, the drunk guy show up agian and screams. I don't want to do anything but just want the scream stop, and guy disappeared.Subconsciously, I go down stairs and gentle move myself to the kitchen. Closing to the where knife was placed, I pick the phone, called 91.
